### Lyrics Editor

LyricsX use custom lyrics file format "LRCX" which support word time tag, multi-language translation and more. Currently there's no official LRCX editor. You can use [Lrcx_Creator](https://github.com/Doublefire-Chen/Lrcx_Creator) for now (see [#544](https://github.com/ddddxxx/LyricsX/issues/544), thanks to [@Doublefire-Chen](https://github.com/Doublefire-Chen)). Or use normal LRC editor, as LRCX is compatible with LRC.
